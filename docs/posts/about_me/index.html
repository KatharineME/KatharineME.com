    <p>Hi everyone, in this post, I&rsquo;d like to reintroduce myself and tell you my story.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Kate Medetgul-Ernar. I&rsquo;m 28 years old and I&rsquo;m cofounder and CEO of Guardiome. I&rsquo;m a mother, a wife, a programmer, and a genomics enthusiast.</p>
<p>My story starts in North Carolina. I grew up in a rural area of North Carolina where I rode horses and cleaned barnes on the weekends. In these early years I spent a lot of time in nature wth good friends, pissing of neighboring farmers and bringing home strange animals. I have a lot of precious memories from this period and this is defintiely where my love of nature comes from.</p>
<p>When I was eleven, my parents split and I moved to Connecticut with my mom. It was a bit of culture shock for me. I started going to a private middle school with uniforms and picked up classical ballet as a hobby. I have to say I wasn&rsquo;t the best student, I wasn&rsquo;t very interested in studying but I genuinely enjoyed biology. Specificaly I became fascinated by evolutionary biology and I would study it in my free time. However during this time, my mom was very busy with work, I was alone a lot, and I struggled with depression. Thankfully though I had ballet as an outlet.</p>
<p>By the time I entered high school, I was absolutey determined to become a professional contemporary ballet dancer. I was all in as they say. I would be up on school nights until 1am practicing in front of my mirror then fall asleep in the splits. I would stretch my feel under my dresser to improve my arch on point. I did it so much that I ended up breaking few metarcles in my foot. In sophmore year of high school I switched to online school so that I could commute into New York City to dance. I danced for 6 to 8 hours during the day and would get my homework done on the train.</p>

<p>During this time I was I danced as a pre-company member in a contemporary ballet company, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. But when I grduated high school and was offered a formal position in the company, I strangley declined. I chose to go to college to study biology instead. In hindsight it was an odd decision considering how hard I had worked for it, but I just had a feeling that there was something important for me to do in the field of biology, so I went to UCSD to studied biochemistry and cell biology.</p>
<p>A few months into my freshman year I met my husband and we have been together ever since. We didn&rsquo;t have money for housing so we lived in a car together for over a year until we got jobs in a wet lab together. In the lab I worked with yeast trying to discover how genes are born. In 2015, my husband and I started Guardiome together. Guardiome was the first completely private whole genome sequence service offered directly to cosumers. We got together a rag tag team of lab members and spent many late nights building and breaking software and hardware. We sort of shocked the DTC genomics market by offering customers a Genome Vault, which was basically our genome on your coffe table. It was a device that could fit in your hand with a small touchscreen for securely storing and searching your DNA.</p>

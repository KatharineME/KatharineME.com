      <description>Assuming that the reference genome is not a true human average (or even if it is) it must contain mutations that are causing a significant portion of humans problems (or at least a phenotype that makes a difference in daily life) that we aren’t paying attention to because they’re defined as “reference”, right?</description>

      <description>General  Samtools is good at calling snps, but most tools are also good at calling snps. Variant calling algorithms have a larger effect on what variants are “found” than alignment algorithms. Novel variants, rare variants, and indels more than snps, have more variance between pipelines. Genomes of European descent are better represented in the public genome knowledge base and are therefore variant called more accurately. Genomes of African descent (where there is greater genetic diversity) , because they are more different from the human reference and the are more likely to have “rare” variants, are prone to more inaccurate variant calling.</description>

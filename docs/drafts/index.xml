      <description>GEO is a public repository for gene expression data, (if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a public repository for raw sequencing data, that&amp;rsquo;s SRA). Individual scientists submit data from their microarray, RNA-Seq, Next-Gen Seq, or other high throughput experiment to make it accessible by the community and in preparation for publications.
It is a great source for gene expression data in a wide range of organisms and experimental designs.

      <description>2022 was an important year for sequencing technology.For the first time, Illumina is facing real competition in short-read sequencing.
In May 2022 Ultima Genomics emerged from stealth mode with a machine (UG 100) that supposedly delivers a $100 genome.
To back up their claim, they</description>

https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/4410953761563-Introducing-DRAGMAP-the-new-genome-mapper-in-DRAGEN-GATK
Learned from the webinar on December 2nd 2022:
Basis for alt aware mapping:
GRCH38 comes with more alternate contigs than grch37 did. And we expect future reference genome versions to continue to increase the number of alternate contigs. Therefore, we need aligners that can take advantage of these smarter reference genomes.
How exactly does it work? What does it mean for there to be a variant in an alt aware section of the genome?</description>

      <description>From this paper on benchmarking practices:
&amp;ldquo;Moving forward, groups will also need to modify benchmarking strategies to address changes in the way the human genome itself is represented. Today the most common way of representing the human genome involves a set of linear chromosomes (e.g., the most common usage of GRCh37). There are key advantages to non-linear representations of the genome, including ability to recognize copy-number and other polymorphisms directly in the reference, and as a result more graphical structures are in development.</description>

      <description>Founding Created in 2009, got popular in 2014.
Computational methods are actively being developed.
Different From Bulk RNASeq More expensive.
More computationally complex.
Typically used for heterogeneous tissue. Bulk RNA Seq is better for homogeneous tissue.
More information. There is an added dimension of knowing what expression came from what cell.
In a typical bulk RNA Seq experiment ~20% of genes will be zero. In a deeply sequenced single cell experiment ~50% will be zeros.</description>

      <description>Load BAM into IGV, scroll through your DNA, and visualize your variants.
If you are a 23andMe customer and have downloaded your 23andMe data file, you can convert this file to a VCF using bcftools: https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/howtos/convert.html
Data is an asset. Getting your genome or exome sequenced and not receiving all your raw and processed data is like buying a house but only using one room.</description>

      <title>Whats in your genome data files and what can you do with them</title>

      <description>Hi folks, today I am going to explain 3 genome data file types (FASTQ, BAM, and VCF). I am going to explain what these files are, what they contain, and roughly how they are structured. If you&amp;rsquo;ve had a DNA test before, depending on the type of DNA test you&amp;rsquo;ve had, you probably received one if not all of these file types. Just to clarify, this post is for everyone, you do not need a PhD to understand whats to come, so no sweat.</description>

      <description>Hi folks, today I am going to compare three methods for collection DNA from a person: blood, swab, and saliva. Stick around to the end to hear which method which consumer DNA company is using and which I recommend.
Before we do the comparison, we need talk about what makes a great DNA sample. Because quality data, starts with a quality sample. There are three factors that determine the quality of a DNA sample: amount, purity, and the degree of degradation.</description>

      <description>Here I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about what a SNP microarray is and how it works with a simple example.
A SNP microarray is a method of checking the allele for hundreds of thousands of SNPs in a single sample or group of samples with. Most SNP microarrays cost around 100 to 200 dollars and are around 99% accurate.
The SNP microarray is a 10 centimeter slide with hundreds of thousands of tiny wells.</description>

Julia is a wonderful new language which combines Python&amp;rsquo;s simplicity with C&amp;rsquo;s speed. So when I considered what language to use for the backend of a web app I&amp;rsquo;m making, naturally I wanted to use Julia. Python has well established web frameworks like flask and Django. But being such a new language I was concerned Julia wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have a fully developed web framework option like Python.</description>

      <description>What is a .dylib? If you are building an app, I&amp;rsquo;m sorry but you cannot escape learning about .dylibs.
dylib = dynamic library.
The goal of dynamic libraries is to reduce the launch time and memory use of an app.
A dynamic library can be directly contrasted with a static library. A static library is a library that is copied into an app&amp;rsquo;s executable file. The upsides of using static libraries are: 1) The app becomes robust and less likely to break, and 2) the app is faster at runtime because all the dependent libraries have already been compiled.</description>

      <description>The human genome is 3.3 billion base pairs long.
75% of RNA-Seq sequences will be ribosomal.
Replicates
Technical replicate: sequence same sample 2x NGS technical replicates are usually 97% matching or better Biological replicate: different individual sequenced under same conditions Reference Genomes 2 major verisons GRCh NIH Genome Reference Consortium Latest release is GRCh38 UCSC Latest release is hg38 Previous release was hg19 After hg19 they decided to jump release number to match GRCh Decoy Genomes When you sequence a human genome, you dont just get human DNA.</description>

      <description>Ever since the human genome was sequenced in 2000, we have been trying to use it to figure out where we came from.
However, this field is at the intersection of society-wide misunderstandings about race / ethnicity, all the problems that come with a new technology (genome sequencing), and a public shortage of sequencing data for diverse human genomes. The obstacles between us and the &amp;ldquo;truth&amp;rdquo; about our genetic heritage are currenlty great.</description>

      <description>Centromere Sequencing How did we manage to model centromere sequences in GRCH38?
Using a rare type of pregnancy called a hydatidiform mole. This happens when a sperm fertilizes and egg without a nucleus.
That sperm then reduplicates its DNA, resulting in two identical copies of each chromosome. Since the resulting cell has no allelic variation, it can be used to generate unambiguous reads in regions with high diversity or repetition.</description>

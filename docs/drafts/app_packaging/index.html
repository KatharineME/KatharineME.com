            <h2 id="what-is-a-dylib">What is a .dylib?</h2>
            <p>
              If you are building an app, I&rsquo;m sorry but you cannot escape
              learning about .dylibs.
            </p>
            <p>dylib = dynamic library.</p>
            <p>
              The goal of dynamic libraries is to reduce the launch time and
              memory use of an app.
            </p>
            <p>
              A dynamic library can be directly contrasted with a static
              library. A static library is a library that is copied into an
              app&rsquo;s executable file. The upsides of using static libraries
              are: 1) The app becomes robust and less likely to break, and 2)
              the app is faster at runtime because all the dependent libraries
              have already been compiled. The downsides are: 1) the app&rsquo;s
              executable becomes large, and 2) when a static library is updated,
              the app executable needs to be rebuilt with the new version of the
              static library.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dynamic libraries are separate files and do not become part of the
              app&rsquo;s executable file. Instead the app carries dynamic
              library references. When the app is run, a link is established
              between the app and the actual dynamic libraries. The upsides are
              1) the app&rsquo;s executable is smaller, and 2) apps
              automatically use and benefit from any upates to the dyanmic
              libraries. The downside is that the app is less robust.
            </p>
            <p>
              A dynamic library is called and activated based on its software
              language and operating system (OS).

            <h2 id="how-to-distribute-an-app">How to Distribute an App</h2>
            <p>
              Assuming that the app is already made and is self-contained, you
              can either distribute it via the Mac App Store, or outside of it.
              If outside the MacApp Store, you need a way to help users install
              the app. To do this, you can use a .dmg or a .pkg.
            </p>
            <h4 id="what-is-a-dmg">What is a .dmg?</h4>
            <p>
              DMG stands for disk image file and is used to install software but
              can contain any type of file. A dmg doesn&rsquo;t know whats
              inside of it. For example, you could make a dmg for a single text
              file, and that dmg would place the text file in the Applications
              folder for example. A .dmg is usually used when a simple copy to
              the Applications folder is needed for example.
            </p>
            <h4 id="what-is-a-pkg">What is a .pkg?</h4>
            <p>
              PKG are macOS installation packages which contain installer
              scripts and compressed installation files that are used to install
              Mac software. A .pkg knows the files iside of it. A .pkg has
              instructions for how the software it carries should be installed.
              When you click on a .pkg, the os will follow the instructions. A
              .pkg can install files in different locations. Generally, people
              will use a .pkg instead of a .dmg when they need to include
              installer scripts.
            </p>
            <h4 id="what-is-a-flat-package">What is a Flat Package?</h4>
            <p>
              &ldquo;Flat Package&rdquo; is usually how people refer to a .pkg
              which installs some kind of application. Flat packages are xar
              archives. You can use <code>pkgutil --expand</code> to open the
              content of a flat package, and <code>pkgutil --flatten</code> to
              recreate the .pkg. Flat packages can be a product archive or a
              component package.
            </p>
            <p>
              A product archive is a meta-package containing one or more
              component packages with an XML file specifying the installer
              behavior. The command line tool <code>productbuild</code> can
              create product archives.
            </p>
            <p>
              A component package is an installer that installs one component.
              It can be included as a part of a product archive, or can be an
              installer on its own.

      <description>Best Docker tutorial
Its purpose is to make a process, with unique environment requirments, run anywhere.
It&amp;rsquo;s built on the Linux kernal. To run on Windows, Docker creates a Linux VM and runs containers in that VM. When the host kernal is Windows or Unix, Docker can interact with it directly.
To run Docker on Mac specifically, the newest and best option is to get Docker Desktop for Mac. Docker Desktop for Mac uses HyperKit (virtualization software) to create a Linux OS.</description>

      <description>VMs  virtualize the hardware come with complete OS and kernal interact with the hardware via a hypervisor run on standby start in minutes usually GBs in size  Containers  virtualize the OS interact with and use the host OS and host kernal  Docker does this via Docker Daemon   will exit without an active process start in seconds usually MBs in size  </description>

      <description>Precision FDA Truth Challenge  Genome in Bottle’s NA12878 also known as HG001. Used to develop the actual tools (overfitted to analyzing this sample). So using this sample to test for accuracy and quality is too easy. The NA24285 sample known as HG002 (the son of an Ashkenazi trio) was about to be released from GiaB (genome in a bottle) as another truth dataset. So this challenge took advantage of that HG002 to assess SA pipelines.</description>

      <description>Pre-processing is an umbrella term that can mean filtering out / trimming low quality reads and reads contaminated with adapter sequences, and / or correcting for sequencing baises such as batch or lane effects. Before you can beging to pre-process reads, you should understand whats below.
FATSQ file naming conventions SampleName_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz
 SampleName &amp;gt; sample name provided S1 &amp;gt; sample number based on order in list of samples. S1 is first sample on the list.</description>

      <description>Fonts Serif
 Has “serifs” at the end of the letters Its the oldest font, from 15th century Gives a trustworthy classic feeling Times New Roman Baskerville  Sans-serif
 Simpler, cleaner, modern, no serifs Helvetica Rubik Arial  Slab serif
 Courier New Rockwell  Pair a bold serif header with a nondescript sans-serif subheader for an approachabe yet sophisticated look.

      <description>Assuming that the reference genome is not a true human average (or even if it is) it must contain mutations that are causing a significant portion of humans problems (or at least a phenotype that makes a difference in daily life) that we aren’t paying attention to because they’re defined as “reference”, right?</description>

      <description>General  Samtools is good at calling snps, but most tools are also good at calling snps. Variant calling algorithms have a larger effect on what variants are “found” than alignment algorithms. Novel variants, rare variants, and indels have more variance between pipelines than SNPs. Genomes of European descent are better represented in the public genome knowledge base and are therefore variant called more accurately. Genomes of African descent (where there is greater genetic diversity) , because they are more different from the human reference and are therefore more likely to have “rare” variants, are prone to more inaccurate variant calling.</description>

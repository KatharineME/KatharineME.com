      <description>If tabix were a character, it would be the swordsman Roronoa Zoro from One Piece, slicing through your genome data to deliver you the result you want.
Tabix is part of Samtools. It indexes a tab-delimted genome position file (VCF file for example). Once indexed, it can quickly retrieve data from any part of the file without decompressing it. Thank you Heng Li üôè (tabix author). Here are some things you can do with tabix to a vcf.</description>

      <title>Globbing and Regex</title>

      <description>This post is all about time saving tools. Globbing is for filename completion in shell and regex is for searching text.
Globbing The asterisk means &amp;ldquo;zero or more characters&amp;rdquo; in the file glob. So this command returns all files ending in .md.
ls *.md This command returns all files starting with A and ending with .md.
ls A*.md The question mark means one unknown character in the file glob. So this command will return All.</description>

      <description>Git LFS Git Large File Storage is a CLI and server made by Github to store large files. It integrates very nicely into the git workflow, making it easy for git users to adopt. Git LFS stores your repoistory&amp;rsquo;s large files in the Git LFS server and adds a link to your repository that points there. Which files in your repository are managed by Git LFS is specified in .gitattributes and manages by git lfs track and git lfs untrack commands.</description>

      <description>Germline and somatic variant caller made by Illumina. All methods are optimized by default for whole genome DNA-Seq. RNA-Seq is still in development and not fully supported. For best somatic indel performance, Strelka is deisgned to be run with Manta. Somatic calls require a matched normal sample to make variant calls. The matached normal sample helps Strelka identify the germline variants versus somatic variants.
Manta A structural variant and indel caller.</description>

      <description>Best Docker tutorial
Docker&amp;rsquo;s makes a process with unique environment requirments run anywhere.
It&amp;rsquo;s built on the Linux kernal. When the host kernal is Windows or Unix, Docker can&amp;rsquo;t interact with it directly. To run on Windows or Mac (Unix kernal), Docker creates a Linux VM and runs containers in that VM.
To run Docker on Mac specifically, the newest and best option is to get Docker Desktop for Mac. Docker Desktop for Mac uses HyperKit (virtualization software) to create a Linux OS.</description>

      <description>The human genome is 3.3 billion base pairs long.
75% of RNA-Seq sequences will be ribosomal.
Replicates
 Technical replicate: sequence same sample 2x  NGS technical replicates are usually 97% matching or better   Biological replicate: different individual sequenced under same conditions  Reference Genomes  2 major verisons  GRCh  NIH Genome Reference Consortium Latest release is GRCh38   UCSC  Latest release is hg38 Previous release was hg19 After hg19 they decided to jump release number to match GRCh      Decoy Genomes When you sequence a human genome, you dont just get human DNA.</description>

      <description>Method 1: BioJulia&amp;rsquo;s GeneticVariation.jl https://github.com/BioJulia/GeneticVariation.jl/blob/master/docs/src/man/io/vcf-bcf.md
BioJulia is an open source project / organization that makes biology tools with Julia. They are actively maintaining many of their repositories. However GeneticVariation.jl has less commit and hasnt been updated much in the last two years. It only has 20 stars and is overall not a very active project. However, it seems to work.
But &amp;hellip;
They are query in a very manual way. THey didnt rea the vcf into a dataframe, or create an index.</description>

      <description>Ever since the human genome was sequenced in 2000, we have been trying to use it to figure out where we came from.
However, this field is at the intersection of society-wide misunderstandings about race / ethnicity, all the problems that come with a new technology (genome sequencing), and a public shortage of sequencing data for diverse human genomes. The obstacles between us and the &amp;ldquo;truth&amp;rdquo; about our genetic heritage are currenlty great.</description>

      <description>Precision FDA Truth Challenge  Genome in Bottle‚Äôs NA12878 also known as HG001. Used to develop the actual tools (overfitted to analyzing this sample). So using this sample to test for accuracy and quality is too easy. The NA24285 sample known as HG002 (the son of an Ashkenazi trio) was about to be released from GiaB (genome in a bottle) as another truth dataset. So this challenge took advantage of that HG002 to assess SA pipelines.</description>

      <description>SAM is the current standard format for storing aligned sequences. It was defined by the community in the early days of the 1000 genomes project.
SAM format tutorial
Samtools commands tutorial
BAM is the compressed version of SAM.
However the newest format is CRAM. A CRAM file is about 30% the size of a BAM file. CRAM is now being adopted by important bioinformatics tools like Samtools.</description>

      <guid>https://katharineme.com/posts/read-preprocessing/</guid>
      <description>Pre-processing is an umbrella term that can mean filtering out / trimming low quality reads and reads contaminated with adapter sequences, and / or correcting for sequencing baises such as batch or lane effects.
Sequencing Biases  Batch effects include any errors that occur after random fragmentation of the DNA until it is input to the flow cell.  e.g., PCR amplification and reverse transcription artifacts.   Lane effects include any errors that occur from the point at which the sample is input to the flow cell until data are output from the sequencing machine.</description>

 SampleName &amp;gt; sample name provided S1 &amp;gt; sample number based on order in list of samples. S1 is first sample on the list. L001 &amp;gt; Lane number R1 &amp;gt; Read number. Paired end sequencing must have at least one R1 file and 1 R2 file. 001 &amp;gt; The last segment is always 001.  Illumina FASTQ naming convention
Format For a single-read run, one Read 1 (R1) FASTQ file is created for each sample per flow cell lane.</description>

      <description>ASCII  Character to number mapping 0-32 are non-written symbols like breaks, sounds, etc. 33 is the first written character and is the exclamation point (!) There are 128 total ASCII characters  UTF-8  UTF-8 is capable of encoding all 1,112,064 valid character code points in Unicode using one to four one-byte code units As of November 2020, UTF-8 accounts on average for 95.8% of all web pages The first 128 characters correspond 1 to 1 with ASCII characters, a big reason for its popularity  </description>

      <description>Initial Quality Check  Check DNA purity on Nanodrop (260/280 ratio shows RNA contamination) Check DNA concentration on Qubit Fluorometer  Fragmentation Two main options for fragmenting the DNA
 Sonication  Uses a sonication machine Pros: very little base bias in cuts made Cons: Sonication machines are expensive, difficult to cut DNA fragments smaller than 300bp   Enzyme digestion  Pros: cheaper, doesnt require large sonication machine Cons: Produces minor base % bias in first 10 bases of fragments  This bias can be easily seen in FastQC results      End Repair and A Tailing In order to ligate the necessary adapters to the fragmented sequences, the ends of the fragments need to be made compatible with those adapters.</description>

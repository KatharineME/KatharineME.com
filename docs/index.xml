      <description>Best Docker tutorial
Its purpose is to make a process, with unique environment requirments, run anywhere.
It&amp;rsquo;s built on the Linux kernal. To run on Windows, Docker creates a Linux VM and runs containers in that VM. When the host kernal is Windows or Unix, Docker can interact with it directly.
To run Docker on Mac specifically, the newest and best option is to get Docker Desktop for Mac. Docker Desktop for Mac uses HyperKit (virtualization software) to create a Linux OS.</description>

      <description>VMs  virtualize the hardware come with complete OS and kernal interact with the hardware via a hypervisor run on standby start in minutes usually GBs in size  Containers  virtualize the OS interact with and use the host OS and host kernal  Docker does this via Docker Daemon   will exit without an active process start in seconds usually MBs in size  </description>

      <description>FASTQ file naming conventions SampleName_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz
 SampleName &amp;gt; sample name provided S1 &amp;gt; sample number based on order in list of samples. S1 is first sample on the list. L001 &amp;gt; Lane number R1 &amp;gt; Read number. Paired end sequencing must have at least one R1 file and 1 R2 file. 001 &amp;gt; The last segment is always 001.  Illumina FASTQ naming convention
FASTQ format For a single-read run, one Read 1 (R1) FASTQ file is created for each sample per flow cell lane.</description>

      <description>The human genome is 3.3 billion base pairs long.
75% of RNA-Seq sequences will be ribosomal.
Replicates
 Technical replicate: sequence same sample 2x  NGS technical replicates are usually 97% matching or better   Biological replicate: different individual sequenced under same conditions  General  Variant calling algorithms have a larger effect on what variants are “found” than alignment algorithms. Novel variants, rare variants, and indels have more variance between pipelines than SNPs.</description>

      <description>ASCII  character to number mapping 0-32 are non-written symbols like breaks, sounds, etc. 33 is the first written character and is the exclamation point (!) There are 128 total ASCII characters  UTF-8  UTF-8 is capable of encoding all 1,112,064 valid character code points in Unicode using one to four one-byte code units As of November 2020, UTF-8 accounts on average for 95.8% of all web pages The first 128 characters correspond 1 to 1 with ASCII characters, a big reason for its popularity  </description>

      <description>Precision FDA Truth Challenge  Genome in Bottle’s NA12878 also known as HG001. Used to develop the actual tools (overfitted to analyzing this sample). So using this sample to test for accuracy and quality is too easy. The NA24285 sample known as HG002 (the son of an Ashkenazi trio) was about to be released from GiaB (genome in a bottle) as another truth dataset. So this challenge took advantage of that HG002 to assess SA pipelines.</description>

      <description>SAM is the current standard format for storing aligned sequences. It was defined by the community in the early days of the 1000 genomes project.
SAM format tutorial
Samtools commands tutorial
BAM is the compressed version of SAM.
However the newest format is CRAM. A CRAM file is about 30% the size of a BAM file. CRAM is now being adopted by important bioinformatics tools like Samtools.</description>

      <description>Pre-processing is an umbrella term that can mean filtering out / trimming low quality reads and reads contaminated with adapter sequences, and / or correcting for sequencing baises such as batch or lane effects.
Sequencing Biases  Batch effects include any errors that occur after random fragmentation of the DNA until it is input to the flow cell.  e.g., PCR amplification and reverse transcription artifacts.   Lane effects include any errors that occur from the point at which the sample is input to the flow cell until data are output from the sequencing machine.</description>

      <description>Assuming that the reference genome is not a true human average (or even if it is) it must contain mutations that are causing a significant portion of humans problems (or at least a phenotype that makes a difference in daily life) that we aren’t paying attention to because they’re defined as “reference”, right?</description>

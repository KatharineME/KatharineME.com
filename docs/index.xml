      <description>2022 was an important year for sequencing technology.For the first time, Illumina is facing real competition in short-read sequencing.
In May 2022 Ultima Genomics emerged from stealth mode with a machine (UG 100) that supposedly delivers a $100 genome.

Learned from the webinar on December 2nd 2022:
Basis for alt aware mapping:
GRCH38 comes with more alternate contigs than grch37 did. And we expect future reference genome versions to continue to increase the number of alternate contigs. Therefore, we need aligners that can take advantage of these smarter reference genomes.
How exactly does it work? What does it mean for there to be a variant in an alt aware section of the genome?</description>

      <description>From this paper on benchmarking practices:
&amp;ldquo;Moving forward, groups will also need to modify benchmarking strategies to address changes in the way the human genome itself is represented. Today the most common way of representing the human genome involves a set of linear chromosomes (e.g., the most common usage of GRCh37). There are key advantages to non-linear representations of the genome, including ability to recognize copy-number and other polymorphisms directly in the reference, and as a result more graphical structures are in development.</description>

      <description>Load BAM into IGV, scroll through your DNA, and visualize your variants.
If you are a 23andMe customer and have downloaded your 23andMe data file, you can convert this file to a VCF using bcftools: https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/howtos/convert.html
Data is an asset. Getting your genome or exome sequenced and not receiving all your raw and processed data is like buying a house but only using one room.</description>

      <description>Hi folks, today I am going to explain 3 genome data file types (FASTQ, BAM, and VCF). I am going to explain what these files are, what they contain, and roughly how they are structured. If you&amp;rsquo;ve had a DNA test before, depending on the type of DNA test you&amp;rsquo;ve had, you probably received one if not all of these file types. Just to clarify, this post is for everyone, you do not need a PhD to understand whats to come, so no sweat.</description>

      <description>Hi folks, today I am going to compare three methods for collection DNA from a person: blood, swab, and saliva. Stick around to the end to hear which method which consumer DNA company is using and which I recommend.
Before we do the comparison, we need talk about what makes a great DNA sample. Because quality data, starts with a quality sample. There are three factors that determine the quality of a DNA sample: amount, purity, and the degree of degradation.</description>

      <description>Here I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about what a SNP microarray is and how it works with a simple example.
A SNP microarray is a method of checking the allele for hundreds of thousands of SNPs in a single sample or group of samples with. Most SNP microarrays cost around 100 to 200 dollars and are around 99% accurate.
The SNP microarray is a 10 centimeter slide with hundreds of thousands of tiny wells.</description>

      <description>Julia&amp;rsquo;s package manager is called Pkg. Pkg creates and manages environments for julia projects, much like npm maintains an environment for each of its packages. Understanding how Pkg works is essential for being effective in julia. So let&amp;rsquo;s dive in.
The Big Picture Pkg prioritizes local project environments over global environments.
But how does Pkg identify a project environment? What constitutes a project? There are two files that Pkg checks for: Project.</description>

Julia is a wonderful new language which combines Python&amp;rsquo;s simplicity with C&amp;rsquo;s speed. So when I considered what language to use for the backend of a web app I&amp;rsquo;m making, naturally I wanted to use Julia. Python has well established web frameworks like flask and Django. But being such a new language I was concerned Julia wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have a fully developed web framework option like Python. I was happily mistaken.</description>

      <description>What is a Module? A module is a self contained unit of code with a separate global scope namespace. It can only see what is inside itself. A module is defined with module NameOfModule ... end. A module can contain files and other modules.
include vs. using include and using are two ways of accessing code in Julia. using tells Julia to reference something that has already been defined, while include tells Julia to copy and define code that was not previously defined.</description>

      <description>DNA vs. RNA Photo credit to biologydictionary.net
 To review, DNA and RNA are different molecules and hold different information. DNA is more or less fixed and consistent across all your cells, with the exception of de novo mutations (in skin cells from UV light for example), whereas RNA produced by the cell is changing all the time.
From acetylation to methylation, alternative splicing, and other regulatory mechanisms, our cells use many different strategies to specialize the way they transcribe and utilize the genome, resulting in different functions (why skin cells are different from heart cells).</description>

      <description>Key Features  Has two main data structures: IndexedTable and NDSparse. Can work with data that is larger than the machine RAM. Allows parallel processing with the addprocs function. Works with Dagger.jl&amp;rsquo;s save and load functions to make a sort of index file adjacent to your table which allows for fast loading and access.  Table  &amp;ldquo;Table&amp;rdquo; refers to both an IndexedTable and NDSparse Tables store data in columns Tables are typed, meaning changing a table requires returning a new table JuliaDB has few mutating operations because a new table is necessary in most cases  Indexed Table  Basically a named tuple of vectors which behaves like a vector of named tuples IndexedTable can be sorted by any number of primary keys (defined using parameter pkey).</description>

      <description>The words that we have available change what we will do. Why Learn Julia? What Are the Value Propositions?  Combines Python&amp;rsquo;s usability with C++ speed  Writing a prototype of code in Python, only to later implement it in C++ for speed is a waste. Now these strengths are in one language. This is accomplished using just in time compilation. The way this works is: you write dynamic Julia code, then Julia compiles it into static Julia, then everything runs super fast.</description>

      <description>This post is all about time saving tools. Globbing is for filename completion in shell and regex is for searching text.
Globbing The asterisk means &amp;ldquo;zero or more characters&amp;rdquo; in the file glob. So this command returns all files ending in .md.
ls *.md This command returns all files starting with A and ending with .md.
ls A*.md The question mark means one unknown character in the file glob. So this command will return All.</description>

      <description>Git LFS Git Large File Storage is a CLI and server made by Github to store large files. It integrates very nicely into the git workflow, making it easy for git users to adopt. Git LFS stores your repoistory&amp;rsquo;s large files in the Git LFS server and adds a link to your repository that points there. Which files in your repository are managed by Git LFS is specified in .gitattributes and manages by git lfs track and git lfs untrack commands.</description>

      <description>Germline and somatic variant caller made by Illumina. All methods are optimized by default for whole genome DNA-Seq. RNA-Seq is still in development and not fully supported. For best somatic indel performance, Strelka is deisgned to be run with Manta. Somatic calls require a matched normal sample to make variant calls. The matached normal sample helps Strelka identify the germline variants versus somatic variants.

Docker makes a process with unique environment requirments run anywhere.
It&amp;rsquo;s built on the Linux kernal. When the host kernal is Windows or Unix, Docker can&amp;rsquo;t interact with it directly. To run on Windows or Mac (Unix kernal), Docker creates a Linux VM and runs containers in that VM.
To run Docker on Mac specifically, the newest and best option is to get Docker Desktop for Mac.</description>

      <description>What is a .dylib? If you are building an app, I&amp;rsquo;m sorry but you cannot escape learning about .dylibs.
dylib = dynamic library.
The goal of dynamic libraries is to reduce the launch time and memory use of an app.
A dynamic library can be directly contrasted with a static library. A static library is a library that is copied into an app&amp;rsquo;s executable file. The upsides of using static libraries are: 1) The app becomes robust and less likely to break, and 2) the app is faster at runtime because all the dependent libraries have already been compiled.</description>

      <description>Ever since the human genome was sequenced in 2000, we have been trying to use it to figure out where we came from.
However, this field is at the intersection of society-wide misunderstandings about race / ethnicity, all the problems that come with a new technology (genome sequencing), and a public shortage of sequencing data for diverse human genomes. The obstacles between us and the &amp;ldquo;truth&amp;rdquo; about our genetic heritage are currenlty great.</description>

      <description>Precision FDA Truth Challenge  Genome in Bottle’s NA12878 also known as HG001. Used to develop the actual tools (overfitted to analyzing this sample). So using this sample to test for accuracy and quality is too easy. The NA24285 sample known as HG002 (the son of an Ashkenazi trio) was about to be released from GiaB (genome in a bottle) as another truth dataset. So this challenge took advantage of that HG002 to assess SA pipelines.</description>

BAM is the compressed version of SAM.
However the newest format is CRAM. A CRAM file is about 30% the size of a BAM file. CRAM is now being adopted by important bioinformatics tools like Samtools.

      <description>Pre-processing is an umbrella term that can mean filtering out / trimming low quality reads and reads contaminated with adapter sequences, and / or correcting for sequencing baises such as batch or lane effects.
Sequencing Biases  Batch effects include any errors that occur after random fragmentation of the DNA until it is input to the flow cell.  e.g., PCR amplification and reverse transcription artifacts.   Lane effects include any errors that occur from the point at which the sample is input to the flow cell until data are output from the sequencing machine.</description>

      <description>ASCII  Character to number mapping 0-32 are non-written symbols like breaks, sounds, etc. 33 is the first written character and is the exclamation point (!) There are 128 total ASCII characters  UTF-8  UTF-8 is capable of encoding all 1,112,064 valid character code points in Unicode using one to four one-byte code units As of November 2020, UTF-8 accounts on average for 95.8% of all web pages The first 128 characters correspond 1 to 1 with ASCII characters, a big reason for its popularity  </description>

      <description>Initial Quality Check  Check DNA purity on Nanodrop (260/280 ratio shows RNA contamination) Check DNA concentration on Qubit Fluorometer  Fragmentation Two main options for fragmenting the DNA
 Sonication  Uses a sonication machine Pros: very little base bias in cuts made Cons: Sonication machines are expensive, difficult to cut DNA fragments smaller than 300bp   Enzyme digestion  Pros: cheaper, doesnt require large sonication machine Cons: Produces minor base % bias in first 10 bases of fragments  This bias can be easily seen in FastQC results      End Repair and A Tailing In order to ligate the necessary adapters to the fragmented sequences, the ends of the fragments need to be made compatible with those adapters.</description>

      <description>Two adults think they may be related based off old photos and records. How do we know for sure? That&amp;rsquo;s the topic of this post.
If it had not been for a potential family member entering our lives, I probably never would have written this. It provided the necessary motivation to learn how kinship estimation works. In this post I give an introduction to kinship from a genetic perspective. Then I describe how I did the genetic kinship analysis to discover I have another family member.</description>

      <description>Fonts Pair a bold serif header with a nondescript sans-serif subheader for an approachabe yet sophisticated look.
Serif
 Has “serifs” at the end of the letters Its the oldest font, from 15th century Gives a trustworthy classic feeling  Sans-serif
 Simpler, cleaner, modern, no serifs  Slab serif
 Has thick slab -like serifs  Visual Hierarchy Golden Ratio 1.618
Golden ratio typography
Hick’s Law With every additional choice increases the time required to make a decision.</description>

      <description>Centromere Sequencing How did we manage to model centromere sequences in GRCH38?
Using a rare type of pregnancy called a hydatidiform mole. This happens when a sperm fertilizes and egg without a nucleus.
That sperm then reduplicates its DNA, resulting in two identical copies of each chromosome. Since the resulting cell has no allelic variation, it can be used to generate unambiguous reads in regions with high diversity or repetition.</description>

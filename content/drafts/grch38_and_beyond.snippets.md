## Centromere Sequencing

How did we manage to model centromere sequences in GRCH38?

Using a rare type of pregnancy called a hydatidiform mole. This happens when a sperm fertilizes and egg without a nucleus.

That sperm then reduplicates its DNA, resulting in two identical copies of each chromosome. Since the resulting cell has no allelic variation, it can be used to generate unambiguous reads in regions with high diversity or repetition.

## Transposable Elements and Centromeres

Transposable elements are just selfish genome parasites, right? Maybe not.

In flies, highly conserved transposable elements form the
functional core of their centromeres. But we dont know yet whether they are active or ancient insertions selected for over time ðŸ¤”.

## GRCH38 Conversion Tool

Need to convert data aligned to GRCH37 to GRCH38?
You may not need to re-align the raw reads.
NCBI has a remapping tool: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/tools/remap

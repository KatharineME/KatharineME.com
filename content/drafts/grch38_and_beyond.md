From [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6699627/#SD1) on benchmarking practices:

"Moving forward, groups will also need to modify benchmarking strategies to address changes in the way the human genome itself is represented. Today the most common way of representing the human genome involves a set of linear chromosomes (e.g., the most common usage of GRCh37). There are key advantages to non-linear representations of the genome, including ability to recognize copy-number and other polymorphisms directly in the reference, and as a result more graphical structures are in development.25 The GRCh38 build of the human genome makes a key step towards this with its use of ALT loci, which provide multiple distinct versions of specific regions of the genome.26 These ALT loci are not well-accounted for by most aligners or the benchmarking tools we describe, and their impact on benchmarking studies is largely unexplored and likely would require a variety of samples with differing ALT alleles. It is likely that the core representation of the genome will continue to evolve over time, and benchmarking tools will continue to evolve."

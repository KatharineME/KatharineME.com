Blood

Traditional source of DNA. Extracted from white blood cells from whole blood. White blood cells are excellent sources of high quality genomic DNA.

Flexibility is limited because person drawing blood usually needs to be certififed.

Blood drawing is invasive.

Saliva

74% of the DNA extracted from saliva comes from white blood cells as well.

To collect the equivalent amount of genomic DNA found in one oragene dna sample kit, you would need to collect 282 buccal swabs or 3 mouthwash samples.

Can be stored at room termperature without dna degredation long-term.

Swab

Collects primarily buccal cells that are lower quality and potentially contaminated with bacteria from teeth or other surfaces.

Swabs also result in greater protein/organic and salt/alcohol contamination.

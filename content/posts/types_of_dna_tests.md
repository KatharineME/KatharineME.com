In this video I'm going to compare three methods dna tests: whole genome sequencing, whole exome sequencing, and genotyping arrays.

Each of these methods are common types of consumer DNA tests, but they are hugely different in terms of usability.

The human genome contains about 3.2 billion DNA base pairs.

23andme for example uses a version of the Illumina Global Screening Array.

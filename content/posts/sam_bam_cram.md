SAM is the current standard format for storing aligned sequences. It was defined by the community in the early days of the 1000 genomes project.

BAM is the compressed version of SAM.

However the newest format is CRAM. A CRAM file is about 30% the size of a BAM file. CRAM is now being adopted by important bioinformatics tools like Samtools.

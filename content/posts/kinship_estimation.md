Take two people who think they may be related based on anecdotal evidence. How do we know for sure? Thats the topic of this post.

Something interesting to consider is that there is no set amount of DNA that biologically related people share. For examlpe, two biological siblings could have been passed many of the same bits of DNA from their parents, or they could been passed many different bits. This is why biological siblings can share between 38%-61% of DNA, with an average of 50%. Then a half siblings should share between 19%-30% of DNA.

Two adults think they may be related based off old photos and records. How do we know for sure? That's the topic of this post.

If it had not been for a potential family member entering our lives, I probably never would have written this. It provided the necessary motivation to learn how kinship estimation works. In this post I give an introduction to kinship from a genetic perspective. Then I describe how I did the genetic kinship analysis to discover I have another family member.

## Genetic Kinship

There is no set amount of DNA that same-related people share. For example, two biological siblings could have been passed many of the same bits of DNA from their parents, or they could been passed many different bits. This element of chance results in the "Range % Shared DNA" column below. 


| Relationship | Average % Shared DNA | Range % Shared DNA |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| Mother / Son      | 52.5% | NA |
| Father / Son      | 47.5% | NA |
| Mother / Daughter | 50%   | NA |
| Father / Daughter | 50%   | NA |
| Full Sibling      | 50%   | 38%-61% |
| Grandparent / Grandchild | 25%   | 17%-34% |
| Aunt or Uncle / Niece or Nephew | 25%   | 17%-34% |
| Half Sibling | 25%   | 17%-34% |
| Great-grandparent / Great-grandchild | 12.5%   | 4%-23% |


For this reason, when comparing two people's genomes, it isn't immediately obvious how they are related. But adding in age and life history can give us the answer we're looking for.

_Side note: Sons and mothers share more DNA simply because the X chromosome is much larger than the Y chromosome._

_Side note: Some DNA we can only get from one of our parents. For boys obviously, the Y chromosome comes from their father. And for everyone, mitochondrial DNA comes from the mother. Whatever mitochondrial DNA the fertilized egg held, is the mitochondrial DNA the child will have._


## Method

So how do we check genetic relatedness? Can't we just check the percent of matching DNA? Easy right? Yes and no.

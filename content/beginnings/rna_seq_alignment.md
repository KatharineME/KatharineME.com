Here we discuss how RNA-Seq alignment diverages from DNA-Seq alignment. But first, we need to fully understand RNA-Seq itself. 


## RNA vs. DNA 

RNA and DNA are different molecules and provide different information. DNA is more or less fixed and consistent across all your cells, with the exception of de novo mutations (in skin cells from UV light for example), whereas RNA produced by the cell is changing all the time.

From acetylaion to methylation, alternative splicing, and other regulatory mechanisms, our cells use a bunch of different strategies to specialize the way they read and transcribe the genome, resulting in very different functions (why our skin cells are so different from heart cells).

RNA is a bit like a snapshot of the cell. Results of RNA-Seq will be vastly different between cell types and over time in the same cell type. For example, the cells might be fighting a pathogan or in the process of division, these will produce vastly different results. Even you may give off a very different impression if someone meets you at work versus out at a bar. Its the same concept. Cell type dependent and time dependent.

In sum: DNA tells you what the cells are working with, RNA tells you what they're up to.


## RNA-Seq

Its a bit of a misnomer because we don't actually sequence the RNA. We first convert it into cDNA, which is much more stable, then sequence it. But lets break it down step by step.

Ever since the human genome was sequenced in 2000, we have been trying to use it to figure out where we came from. 

However, this field is at the intersection of society-wide misunderstandings about race / ethnicity, all the problems that come with a new technology (genome sequencing), and a public shortage of sequencing data for diverse human genomes. The obstacles between us and the "truth" about our genetic heritage are currenlty great. But these obstacles will be slowly toppled by better technology, better bioinformatics, and more human genome sequences.

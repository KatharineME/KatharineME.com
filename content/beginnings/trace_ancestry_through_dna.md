Ever since the human genome was sequenced in 2000, we have been trying to use it to figure out where we came from. 

However, this field is at the intersection of society-wide misunderstandings about race / ethnicity, all the problems that come with a new technology (genome sequencing), and a public shortage of sequencing data for diverse human genomes. The obstacles between us and the "truth" about our genetic heritage are currenlty great. But these obstacles will be slowly toppled by better technology, better bioinformatics, and more human genome sequences.


## Up to Now

So where are we now?


## Comprehensive Analysis of Genetic Ancestry and Its Molecular Correlates in Cancer Paper

They determined genetic ancestry using 5 different "methods".

Among the  9,257 patients for whom at least three methods provided base calls, 98.1 percent exhibited agreement and 99.7 percent of admixed patients exhibited condordance with prior ancestry assignments from Yuan et al 2018.

The data they used for ancestry classification was either SNP array and or whole-exome sequencing.



## Up Next

How will we improve?

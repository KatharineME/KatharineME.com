## General

- Samtools is good at calling snps, but most tools are also good at calling snps.
- Variant calling algorithms have a larger effect on what variants are “found” than alignment algorithms.
- Novel variants, rare variants, and indels have more variance between pipelines than SNPs.
- Genomes of European descent are better represented in the public genome knowledge base and are therefore variant called more accurately. Genomes of African descent (where there is greater genetic diversity) , because they are more different from the human reference and are therefore more likely to have “rare” variants, are prone to more inaccurate variant calling.

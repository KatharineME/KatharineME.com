The human genome is 3.3 billion base pairs long.

75% of RNA-Seq sequences will be ribosomal.

Replicates
- Technical replicate: sequence same sample 2x
    - NGS technical replicates are usually 97% matching or better
- Biological replicate: different individual sequenced under same conditions

ASCII
- character to number mapping 
- 0-32 are non written symbols like breaks, sounds, etc.
- 33 is the first written character and is the exclamation point (!)
- There are 128 total ASCII characters

Quality Scores in FASTQ files

UTF-8
- UTF-8 is capable of encoding all 1,112,064 valid character code points in Unicode using one to four one-byte code units
- As of November 2020, UTF-8 accounts on average for 95.8% of all web pages
- The first 128 characters correspond 1 to 1 with ASCII characters, a big reason for its popularity

## General

- Variant calling algorithms have a larger effect on what variants are “found” than alignment algorithms.
- Novel variants, rare variants, and indels have more variance between pipelines than SNPs.
- Genomes of European descent are better represented in the public genome knowledge base and are therefore variant called more accurately. Genomes of African descent (where there is greater genetic diversity) , because they are more different from the human reference and are therefore more likely to have “rare” variants, are prone to more inaccurate variant calling.

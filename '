Assuming that the app is already made and is self-contained, you can either distribute it via the Mac App Store, or outside of it. If outside the MacApp Store, you need a way to help users install the app. To do this, you can use a .dmg or a .pkg.

#### What is a .dmg?
DMG stands for disk image file and is used to install software but can contain any type of file. A dmg doesn't know whats inside of it. For example, you could make a dmg for a single text file, and that dmg would place the text file in the Applications folder for example. A .dmg is usually used when a simple copy to the Applications folder is needed for example.

#### What is a .pkg?
PKG are macOS installation packages which contain installer scripts and compressed installation files that are used to install Mac software. A .pkg knows the files iside of it. A .pkg has instructions for how the software it carries should be installed. When you click on a .pkg, the os will follow the instructions. A .pkg can install files in different locations. Generally, people will use a .pkg instead of a .dmg when they need to include installer scripts.

#### What is a Flat Package?
"Flat Package" is usually how people refer to a .pkg which installs some kind of application. Flat packages are xar archives. You can use `pkgutil --expand` to open the content of a flat package, and `pkgutil --flatten` to recreate the .pkg. Flat packages can be a product archive or a component package.

A product archive is a meta-package containing one or more component packages with an XML file specifying the installer behavior. The command line tool `productbuild` can create product archives.

A component package is an installer that installs one component. It can be included as a part of a product archive, or can be an installer on its own.

Electron.jl or Blink.jl are both Julia wrappers on Electron.

![app store](/images/app_store.png)

Before getting into the step by step process, you need to know the following about submitting an app to the app store:

- The first step is applying the the Apple Developer Program and it takes months to be approved
- Apps needs to be submitted through Xcode
- Two potentially helpful video tutorials if questions come up:

    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXeDe9tafG8&t=84s


#### 1. Enroll in Apple Developer Program

- https://developer.apple.com/programs/

#### 2. Setup Apple Developer Account 

- Sign all contracts in App Store Connect under "Agreements, Tax and Banking"

#### 3. Create an Xcode Project

#### 4. Register Bundle ID on App Store Connect

- Go to Xcode, in your app project go to Signing & Capabilities, click on Capabilities, search for In-App Purchase, and it should automatically create a provising profile/bundle id. Go back to App Store Connect and youn should see your app under the Identifiers section.

#### 5. Create a New App in App Store Connect

- Go to My Apps > add an app > check macOS > etc.

#### 6. Add App Icon Set to App Project in Xcode

- https://appicon.co

#### 7. Add Version and Build Number in Xcode

#### 8. Add Your Apple ID Under Xcode/Preferences/Accounts

#### 9. Test App in Xcode simulator

#### 10. Archive the Project

- Select the correct device 
- Go to Product > Archive

#### 11. Validate App

- In Xcode go to Archives and click Validate App
- Keep default values
- Select automatically manage signing
- It may take some time
- It will say validation was successful in the end

#### 12. Distribute App

This basically uploads the app to App Store Connect.

- In Xcode got to Archives and click Distribute App
- Select App Store COnnect
- Select Upload
- Keep defaults
- Select Automatically manage signing
- Then an Upload progress bar should appear
- In the end it will say sucessfuly uploaded

#### 13. Check TestFlight in App Store Connect

- Go to App Store Connect and in the dropdown select TestFlight
- It will say the app is processing

#### 14. Select the Build To Be Reviewed

#### 15. Submit for Review
